# Linked List

## Description

In this repository I have included the entire source code of a fully working linked list implemented in C.

## Directions

There are many ways of compiling the source code, you can either:

1. compile test_list.c which is the test file demonstrating the various functions of the linked list or
2. use the makefile that I provided and type "make" in your terminal (ubuntu)
